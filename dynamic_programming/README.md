### Dynamic Programming 
Dynamic programming is an algorithm technique which is usually based on 
* recurrent formula
* one or more starting states
A sub-solution of the problem is constructed from previously found ones, which starts from the starting states.
DP solutions have a polynomial complexity where the brute-force or backtracking solutions usually have exponantial solutions.
And it computes the recurrence efficiently because it stores the sub-probelms and use the results instead of recalculating them everytime.

examples of Dynamic Programmign here are:
* Fibonacci number
* Longest Increasing Sub Sequence
* Min number of coins used to add to a sum
